  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Fluxley ("we", "our", or "us") is a Shopify app that provides AI-powered price negotiation capabilities for online stores. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect information when you use our application.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data responsibly. This policy applies to merchants who install Fluxley and their customers who interact with our negotiation widget.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>1. Merchant Information</h3>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

  <h3>Merchant Data</h3>
  <p>We use merchant information to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticate and authorize access to your Shopify store</li>
    <li>Configure negotiation parameters (min/max discount percentages)</li>
    <li>Process billing and calculate usage-based charges (commission on sales)</li>
    <li>Display dashboard analytics showing negotiation performance</li>
    <li>Provide customer support</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Customer Data</h3>
  <p>We use customer information to:</p>

    <li>Messages are processed in real-time and are stateless</li>
    <li>Anthropic uses prompt caching for system instructions (ephemeral cache only)</li>
    <li>No conversation data is retained after the negotiation session ends</li>
